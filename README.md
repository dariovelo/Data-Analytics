This project is a Haskell-based implementation focused on processing student exam data from a CSV table. 
It performs various tasks, such as calculating exam grades, determining the number and percentage of students who passed, averaging exam grades, and analyzing homework contributions. 
The project also ranks students based on their performance and calculates differences between interview and written exam scores.
